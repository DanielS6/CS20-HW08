            <strong>Describe the API you selected and what it does</strong>
            <p>
            The API I selected in the MediaWiki Action API, which allows clients
            to interact with a MediaWiki wiki programmatically, rather than
            requiring loading the user interface. It is used for everything
            from making edits, to changing account permissions, to even deleting
            or undeleting a page. See the full documentation on
            <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/API:Main_page">
                MediaWiki.org</a>
            for further details.

            <strong>Cite the website where you found it</strong>
            <p>
            The website where I found the API endpoint that I was accessing
            is on the English Wikipedia, at
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php">
                https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php</a>,
            which also provides human-readable documentation for the different
            ways that the API can be used.
